## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This challenge gave me a chance to learn more about measurements - specifically vw and vh. I also gained a better understanding of the background element in CSS thanks to CSStricks.

### Useful resources

- [CSSTricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - As mentioned above, this helped me understand the background property more by utilizing background-image, background-repeat, background-position, and background-position-x and -y.
